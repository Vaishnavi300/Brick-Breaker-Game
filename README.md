# Brick-Breaker-Game

Brick Breaker is a classic arcade game where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks.
For the Brick Breaker game, I'll be using the Pygame library, which provides functionality for creating games and multimedia applications.
The game consists of a rectangular grid of bricks, a paddle, and a ball. The player controls the paddle horizontally at the bottom of the screen, using it to bounce the ball and prevent it from falling off the screen. The goal is to break all the bricks on the screen by repeatedly hitting them with the ball. As the player progresses, the game becomes more challenging with different layouts, power-ups, and obstacles.
